üìù Description & Problem
Description:

Automate the extraction and reconciliation of key financial data from customer Order Forms with Salesforce to reduce manual effort and improve reporting accuracy.

Long Description:

Finance and Accounting teams manually extract and validate ARR and financial data from Order Forms and Salesforce. This process is error-prone, time-consuming (~40‚Äì50 hours/month), and impacts reporting accuracy. The GenAI-powered solution reads PDFs, extracts structured data, reconciles it against Salesforce, and stores results in Snowflake and Box.

Business Problem:

Manual processing of Order Forms to calculate financial metrics leads to errors, scalability issues, and potential revenue loss due to misreporting.

Proposed Solution:

Use SnapLogic GenAI Builder to automate PDF data extraction, reconcile with Salesforce data, and write validated outputs to Snowflake and Box.
